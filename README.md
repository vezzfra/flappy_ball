# Flappy Ball
My very first iOS app. 

I was 13 when I first started developing this little game. It was based on the idea of the famous Flabby Bird, but was using a ball as protagonist. 

The game was an endless-type one based on different levels, these were different in speed and difficulty and the end of the level was reached when a determined number of points were earned. 

Flappy ball included: 

  • Endless-type levels;
  • Customizable ball, the user was able to buy different dresses for it spending the points he earned or buying more points with In-App Purchasings;
  • Infinite number of levels with increasing and decreasing speed and obstacles;
  • Random obstacle generation, keeping track of the position of the last 'gate' in order to let the next one to be reachable by the user. 
  

This project was never published on the App Store and remained only
